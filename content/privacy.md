Thank you for choosing Lazulite. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to safeguarding your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to protect your data when you use our Android application available on the Google Play Store.

## Information We Collect:

- Anonymous Data via Firebase Analytics: We collect anonymous data about how users interact with our app to improve its functionality and user experience. This data does not personally identify individual users.

- Crash Reports via Crashlytics: When the app encounters issues, anonymous crash reports are sent to help us identify and address potential problems. These reports do not contain personal user information.

- System Logs: Users have the option to send us system logs to assist in resolving technical issues. While these logs can provide valuable information for troubleshooting, they may also contain sensitive information about the user's device. Sending system logs is entirely voluntary.

## How We Use Your Information:

- Improvement & Development: The anonymous data from Firebase Analytics helps us understand how users interact with our app, allowing us to enhance user experience and introduce new features.

- Troubleshooting: Crashlytics reports and system logs aid us in identifying and rectifying technical issues to ensure smooth app performance.

## Data Sharing and Transfer:

We do **not** sell, trade, or transfer your information to third parties. However, Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics, run by Google, may store and process the data. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for more details on how they manage data.

## Data Protection:

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of the data we collect. While we strive to protect your information, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## User's Consent:

By using our app, you consent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policy, please refrain from using our application.
