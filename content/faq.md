# Lazulite Frequently Asked Questions

## I'm stuck at the ADB permissions screen

If you're stuck at the ADB permissions screen, I've written the following tutorial to help get unfamiliar users unblocked:

## Does Lazulite have an impact on battery life?

Lazulite is designed to have a minimal impact on battery life. It only runs when you're using it, and it doesn't run in the background.

The way it works is by looking at logs meant for development purposes. These logs live on your phone/tablet, therefore there is **no impact
whatsoever**  on the battery life of your bluetooth device.

## Does Lazulite have an impact on data usage?

Lazulite might collect basic usage and crash data. This data is anonymized, and this functionality is provided by Google Firebase, so it's highly optimized for mobile devices as well as compliant with the latest privacy regulations for all regions.
However, if you so wish you can opt out of this data collection by going to the settings screen and disabling the Telemetry data option.
